#  Unibuc FMI 2024-2025 Bachelor's Project
## Procedurally Generated Adventure Game

The project consists of a 2D Top-Down Roguelike game created using Unity. The player has to
progress through procedurally generated levels using various combinations of spells (that have to
be found throughout the game) to defeat a certain
number of enemies to be able to enter the next level.
The game is heavily modularized, allowing for easy
scaling if needed.
